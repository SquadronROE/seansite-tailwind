This site has been built off of a free template linked above. The purpose of this was to allow for fast development off of a sufficiently complex code base, setting up a play space for automated testing tools to be explored and utilized.

**The Problem**

Many times personal sites showcase a user's ability to provide a sufficiently complex site and backend to demonstrate their skills and proficiency. While this works great for Front End, Back End and Full Stack developers, it's harder for people whose skills are focused on supporting disciplines (such as SRE, Quality, or Security). While in many cases these supporting disciplines are handled by individual developers, these disciplines can benefit from dedicated focus as well.

This site exists as a way for me to explore automated testing tools and methodologies without incurring the overhead of having to develop both front- and back-end systems to a sufficient degree of complexity to lead to the sorts of testing situations that require innovation.

**Documentation for site**

Each element is well presented in very complex documentation.

You can read more about the [documentation here](https://www.material-tailwind.com/docs/react/installation).

**Example Pages**

If you want to get inspiration or just show something directly to your clients, you can jump-start your development with our pre-built example pages. You will be able to quickly set up the basic structure for your web project.
